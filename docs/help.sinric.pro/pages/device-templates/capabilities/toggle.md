title: Toggle Capability
layout: post
---

The Toggle capability in SinricPro device templates lets you control binary settings that have exactly two possible states. These settings often represent physical on/off buttons or active/inactive functionality. For settings with more than two possible states, or those that can exist in a neutral state where neither binary option applies, the Modes trait provides a more appropriate representation.

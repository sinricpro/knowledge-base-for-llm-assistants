We are innovating new ways with Sinric to make smart homes more efficient and help everyone have a positive impact on the planet

Sinric will use your device's on/off state to determine how long a device has been turned on and combine this with the device's energy consumption that you specify when you create a device to provide you an estimate of your deviceâ€™s energy consumption. 

**Step 1:** Enter the device's energy consumption.

**Step 2:** Turn on the device and turn it off after a while. Sinric Pro will calculate how many hours the device has been turned on and calculate the watt hour rate.

After a while these data will be available in Amazon Alexa app as well.

**Note**  You must use Sinric Pro system to turn on and off the device to calculate energy consumption

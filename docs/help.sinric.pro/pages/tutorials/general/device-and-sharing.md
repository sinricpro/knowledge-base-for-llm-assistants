# SinricPro Device & Data Sharing Guide

As of now, **SinricPro does not officially support device or data sharing between different user accounts**.

---

## Current Limitations

- **No Built-in Sharing Feature**  
  SinricPro is designed for individual user accounts to manage their own devices. There is currently no native functionality in the SinricPro dashboard or API to share.

---

## Workarounds (Limited & Manual)

If you need to “share” access to devices with others, here are some possible workarounds:

### Shared Account Credentials

You can share your SinricPro account login with trusted individuals.

**Not Recommended** — This grants full access to all your devices and settings. Security and privacy risks apply.

## Summary

**No native sharing — but creative workarounds exist for developers or via third-party platforms like Home Assistant.**

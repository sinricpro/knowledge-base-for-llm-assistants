3. Go to **Skills & Games**.
4. Tap **Your Skills** (tap the filter/dropdown if you see “All Skills”).
5. Search for or scroll to find **“SinricPro”**.
6. Tap the **SinricPro skill**.

## 🔄 Step 2: Remove SinricPro Devices from Alexa (Recommended)

After disabling the skill, remove associated devices for a clean setup:

1. In the Alexa app, go to **Devices** → **All Devices**.
2. Locate devices linked to SinricPro (look for names or “Skill” tag).
3. Tap each device → scroll down → tap **Delete** or **Remove**.

> 💡 **Note**: This only removes devices from Alexa — it does *not* delete them from your SinricPro account or cloud.

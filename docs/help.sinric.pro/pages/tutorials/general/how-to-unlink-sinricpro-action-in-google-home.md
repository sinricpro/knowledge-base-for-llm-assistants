## 🔄 Step 2: Remove SinricPro Devices from Google Home (Recommended)

After unlinking, remove old devices to clean up your Google Home interface:

1. In the Google Home app, go to **Favorites** or **Devices** tab.
2. Find devices associated with SinricPro (look for “Via SinricPro” or similar tag).
3. Tap the device → tap **Settings (gear icon)** → scroll down → tap **Remove device**.
4. Confirm removal.

> 💡 **Note**: Removing devices in Google Home does *not* delete them from your SinricPro account — only removes voice/app control via Google.
